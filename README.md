📊 Business Intelligence Engineer Project: Student Enrollment & Satisfaction Analysis

Author: Lamia Ghozy

🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages AWS QuickSight to analyse student enrollment and satisfaction data for a regional community college. The objective was to identify the key drivers behind professor evaluation scores, track improvements over time, and recommend cost-effective strategies to improve student satisfaction without increasing course expenses.

The work simulates a real-world BI consulting project, combining data modelling, dashboard development, scenario-based analysis, and data storytelling to deliver actionable recommendations.

🧭 Decision Intelligence Context

This project was designed to address a core decision failure within Career4All’s coaching operations:  
Career coaches lacked a scalable, consistent, and objective way to assess skill gaps and prioritise training recommendations across a growing learner base.

Before this system, coaching decisions relied heavily on manual review, individual judgment, and fragmented training references, resulting in variability in outcomes, lengthy turnaround times, and limited scalability.

The Career4All Coaching Application reframes career coaching as a decision intelligence problem — transforming unstructured documents into actionable insights that support faster, more consistent, and auditable coaching decisions.


🎯 Business Problem

Community colleges face the dual challenge of:

Improving professor performance evaluations.

Maintaining or reducing course delivery costs.

This project examines the impact of faculty, courses, and institutional improvements on student satisfaction, offering insights into scaling high-performing, low-cost teaching strategies.

🎯 Design Principles & Trade-offs

Key design decisions were made to prioritise scalability, security, and coaching consistency over bespoke, one-off analysis:

• No-code architecture was selected to reduce operational dependency on engineering teams.  
• Centralised catalogues were used to enforce training consistency across coaches.  
• Human-in-the-loop refinement was preserved to balance automation with professional judgement.  

These trade-offs ensured the system could scale organisationally without sacrificing coaching quality.

📂 Deliverables

The project includes the following components:

Datasets: Field preparation, calculated fields (e.g., Student Type), and refresh schedules.

Analyses: Multiple visuals exploring enrollment trends, course evaluations, and cost-performance dynamics.

Dashboards: An interactive Student Enrollment Dashboard with clear labelling and business-oriented visuals.

Topics & Verified Answers: Natural language queries with validated responses across students, professors, and courses.

Scenario Analysis: A multi-step reasoning path answering: “How do we improve professor evaluations while avoiding an increase in cost per course?”

Data Story: A polished narrative that integrates dashboard visuals and custom text, culminating in strategic recommendations for decision-makers.

📈 Business Impact & Outcomes

• Reduced manual skill-gap analysis time from hours to seconds (>90% efficiency gain).  
• Improved consistency of training recommendations across coaches.  
• Enabled secure scaling of coaching operations without proportional headcount growth.  
• Ensured training recommendations remain current through automated data synchronisation.

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

Data Modelling & Transformation: Created custom calculated fields to enrich analysis (e.g., distinguishing between youth and adult continuing education students).

BI Visualisation: Designed impactful visuals with appropriate chart types, clear labelling, and strong alignment to business objectives.

Scenario-Based Analysis: Developed a structured thread of questions progressing from broad factors to targeted insights.

Data Storytelling: Built a professional, boardroom-ready report combining narrative with analytics.

Dashboard Design: Balanced usability, clarity, and depth for decision-makers.

Cloud BI Tooling: Hands-on application of AWS QuickSight for end-to-end BI project execution.


📌 Key Insights & Recommendations

High evaluation scores are strongly linked to specific teaching practices and course improvements (notably Accounting and Statistics in 2022).

Cost-effective excellence was demonstrated in courses like Data Visualisation, proving that quality does not always require high resource expenditure.

To maximise impact, the college should:

Replicate teaching practices of consistently high-rated professors.

Scale up courses with strong evaluations and low delivery costs.

Continue monitoring course-level improvements to sustain long-term satisfaction gains.
