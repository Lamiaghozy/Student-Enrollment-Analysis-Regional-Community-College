üìä Business Intelligence Engineer Project: Student Enrollment & Satisfaction Analysis

Author: Lamia Ghozy

üöÄ Project Overview

This project leverages AWS QuickSight to analyse student enrollment and satisfaction data for a regional community college. The objective was to identify the key drivers behind professor evaluation scores, track improvements over time, and recommend cost-effective strategies to improve student satisfaction without increasing course expenses.

The work simulates a real-world BI consulting project, combining data modelling, dashboard development, scenario-based analysis, and data storytelling to deliver actionable recommendations.

üéØ Business Problem

Community colleges face the dual challenge of:

Improving professor performance evaluations.

Maintaining or reducing course delivery costs.

This project investigates how faculty, courses, and institutional improvements influence student satisfaction and provides insights into scaling high-performing, low-cost teaching strategies.

üìÇ Deliverables

The project includes the following components:

Datasets: Field preparation, calculated fields (e.g., Student Type), and refresh schedules.

Analyses: Multiple visuals exploring enrollment trends, course evaluations, and cost-performance dynamics.

Dashboards: An interactive Student Enrollment Dashboard with clear labelling and business-oriented visuals.

Topics & Verified Answers: Natural language queries with validated responses across students, professors, and courses.

Scenario Analysis: A multi-step reasoning path answering: ‚ÄúHow do we improve professor evaluations while avoiding an increase in cost per course?‚Äù

Data Story: A polished narrative that integrates dashboard visuals and custom text, culminating in strategic recommendations for decision-makers.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

Data Modelling & Transformation: Created custom calculated fields to enrich analysis (e.g., distinguishing between youth and adult continuing education students).

BI Visualisation: Designed impactful visuals with appropriate chart types, clear labelling, and strong alignment to business objectives.

Scenario-Based Analysis: Developed a structured thread of questions progressing from broad factors to targeted insights.

Data Storytelling: Built a professional, boardroom-ready report combining narrative with analytics.

Dashboard Design: Balanced usability, clarity, and depth for decision-makers.

Cloud BI Tooling: Hands-on application of AWS QuickSight for end-to-end BI project execution.

üìå Key Insights & Recommendations

High evaluation scores are strongly linked to specific teaching practices and course improvements (notably Accounting and Statistics in 2022).

Cost-effective excellence was demonstrated in courses like Data Visualisation, proving that quality does not always require high resource expenditure.

To maximise impact, the college should:

Replicate teaching practices of consistently high-rated professors.

Scale up courses with strong evaluations and low delivery costs.

Continue monitoring course-level improvements to sustain long-term satisfaction gains.
